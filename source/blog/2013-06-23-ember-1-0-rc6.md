Ember.js 1.0 RC6 has just been released and is now available from the
main website as well as [builds.emberjs.com](http://builds.emberjs.com).

The biggest change is the router facelift which addresses two major issues. The first
was inconsistent semantics between URL based transitions and transition. The second
was spotty async support which made it difficult to prevent or delay route entry in
cases such as authentication and async code-loading.

URL and transitionTo semantics have now been harmonized and async has been embraced
with promises.

Additionally, router transitions have become first-class citizens and there are
new hooks to prevent or decorate transitions:

 willTransition: fires on current routes whenever a transition is about to take place
 beforeModel/model/afterModel: hooks fired during the async validation phase

Finally there is an error even which fires whenever there is a rejected promise or
error event in any of the beforeModel/model/afterModel hooks.

For an overview of new router features, see:

Special thanks to Alex Machtneer for his work on this!

The other major change is the introduction of Ember Components, which share the vision
of Web Components, of allowing creation of reusable higher-level page elements.  Ember
Components are views whose templates rely on them completely for property access and
actions.  Any reference to outside constructs is handled through context info passed
 into the view.
